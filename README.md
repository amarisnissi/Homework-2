# Homework-2
## 1. Type the following in the command window and submit the results. Briefly explain what each assignment does.

>> a = 1                  This sets 'a' as the variable for 1.

>> b = 'x'                This did not set 'b' to be a variable for 'x' and caused an error.
>> c = true               This sets 'c' 
>> whos a b c
>> a == c
>> a + c
>> d = [1 2 3 4]
>> e = ['a' 'b' 'c' 'd']
>> f = ['abcd']
>> g = {‘a’ ‘b’ ‘c’ ‘d’}
>> h = { a b c d}
>> whos d e f g h
